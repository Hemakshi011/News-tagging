# News-tagging
The main goal of this project is to automate the classification of news items about the company's suppliers and Original Equipment Manufacturers (OEMs). The dataset used in this project is web scrapeed by us as well. The objective is to classify each article according to its content into one of the following categories: Issues, Risks, Opportunities, or No Risk. The system analyses the content using sophisticated Natural Language Processing (NLP) algorithms to find information about possible business consequences. The initiative is to support proactive decision-making by labelling articles in these categories in order to deliver timely insights into the performance and issues related to OEMs and suppliers.

The project entails:

Compiling news stories from several sources.

Evaluating the information in order to group it into pre-established groups.

Using BERT and other algorithms to precisely tag the articles.
